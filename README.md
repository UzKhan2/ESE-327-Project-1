# ESE-327-Project-1

Implement the Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm for mining frequent  item sets:                                                                      

- The algorithm implements a tree system to store the frequent data sets in order
- Have an array containing pointers linking all like data sets
- Minimize run time
 
 <br /> Program inputs:

- Data Values (CSV)
- Data Names
